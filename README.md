# RogueLike-Game
A dungeon/cavern exploration game, based on some 80's RPG's

It was a project for my Data Structures class, on the college. I've choosen this among other suggested projects because I aways liked RPG games, RTS and so on, and I saw a opportunity to create one from scratch.

Basically, it's a game with "infinite", random procedural levels, in which they are stored and accessed via a double-linked list. The structure for each map contains information about the terrain, if it's accessible, visible or explored, and the size.
